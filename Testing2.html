  Forget construction! Forget renovations! You don&rsquo;t  need to be an expert or know&nbsp;<em>anything</em>about how to rehab a property yourself. In most cases, you  really only need to know one thing:&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Is the property  suitable for building?&rdquo;</strong>As  long as&nbsp;<em>someone else</em>&nbsp;can build on the land  if/when they want to, a huge part of the battle is already won.<br>

<p><strong>2) Raw&nbsp;Land is a &ldquo;Hands-Off&rdquo; Investment.</strong><br>
  Have you had enough of dealing with tenants,  toilets, bugs, mold, lawn care, leaking roofs, bursting pipes, broken furnaces,  and the&nbsp;<em>hundreds of other issues</em>&nbsp;that come with owning buildings? Vacant land doesn&rsquo;t involve ANY  of those things. Once you buy it… &nbsp; it sits there, it behaves itself, and&nbsp;<strong>nothing happens</strong>.<br>
  <strong>3) Statistically, Vacant Land Owners are&nbsp;<em>Highly  Motivated to Sell</em>.</strong><br>
  Why? Because vacant land owners (by default)  are&nbsp;<strong><em>always&nbsp;absentee owners</em></strong>.&nbsp;When a person doesn&rsquo;t  live inside of (or even near) the property they&rsquo;re trying to sell, there is  less of an &ldquo;emotional connection&rdquo; – because it isn&rsquo;t their primary residence.  In many cases, you&rsquo;ll find that&nbsp;<a href="http://retipster.com/understanding-the-motivated-seller/">these sellers</a>&nbsp;are willing to sell their  land for&nbsp;<em>pennies on the dollar –</em>&nbsp;simply because they don&rsquo;t  live anywhere near it, it&rsquo;s not producing any income for them (because they  don&rsquo;t know how to optimize their land correctly) and as a result,<em>&nbsp;</em><em>they are much more apathetic about it</em>. Find these people, and you will find some  incredible deals.<br>
  <strong>4) Land Investors Have Virtually&nbsp;<u>No  Competition</u>&nbsp;to Deal With.</strong><br>
  Are you tired of dealing with such stiff  competition on every property you try to buy?&nbsp;Are you sick of getting  outbid on every good deal you&rsquo;re lucky enough to find? Well guess what…  &nbsp;there is&nbsp;virtually<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>no  competition in the world of raw land investing</strong>. &nbsp;You see… most real estate investors  have their minds stuck on: &ldquo;houses&rdquo;, &ldquo;apartments&rdquo;, &ldquo;commercial property&rdquo;,  because&nbsp;<em>that&rsquo;s what everyone else does</em>. Most investors don&rsquo;t understand the superior  benefits of land and this can&nbsp;<em>definitely</em>&nbsp;play to your advantage.<br>
  <strong>5) Land Investors Call Their Own Shots.</strong><br>
  When you buy vacant land the right way, it&rsquo;s  easy to&nbsp;buy each property with your own&nbsp;cash and&nbsp;<em>completely avoid dealing with banks and mortgage companies</em>.&nbsp;When I got started as a&nbsp;land  investor, I had $3,000 to my name and&nbsp;<em>to this day,</em>&nbsp;<em>I have never had to borrow money from a bank.</em><em>&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Ever</em></strong><em>.&nbsp;</em>When you&nbsp;<a href="http://retipster.com/findingmotivatedsellers1/">know  where to look for great deals on land</a>, it requires&nbsp;<strong>very little start-up capital</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>to get your business up and running.<br>
  <strong>6) When You Learn How to&nbsp;<a href="http://retipster.com/?p=131">Research  Properties Effectively</a>, you can Buy and Sell Vacant  Land&nbsp;Properties&nbsp;<em>Without Ever Seeing Them In-Person</em>.</strong><br>
  In 2011, I bought and sold a parcel of land  and grossed over&nbsp;<strong>$44,000</strong>. The entire process took me 5 months from start to finish and  to this day,&nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;ve never actually seen this property with my  own eyes</em>. Everything was done&nbsp;<strong>virtually,</strong>&nbsp;using the tools that you and I have available  for FREE online. The beauty of land is that&nbsp;<em>it doesn&rsquo;t involve any  structures</em>. This means the  inspection process is VERY simple – and if you&rsquo;re&nbsp;<a href="http://retipster.com/truthaboutlandinvesting/">doing  the right research</a>, you can easily buy your properties&nbsp;without  ever visiting them in person.<br>
  <strong>7) Add&nbsp;<a href="http://retipster.com/?p=2904">Seller  Financing</a>&nbsp;to the Mix and EXPLODE Your Income Potential.</strong><br>
  When you combine vacant land with the power  of&nbsp;<a href="http://retipster.com/?p=2904">Seller  Financing</a>, it&rsquo;s a match made in heaven. It can open up the doors to  finding MANY more buyers, because most banks are very hesitant to lend money on  vacant land. Due to the scarcity of &ldquo;easy money&rdquo; financing, a land investor can  use this to their advantage by charging a higher-than-market interest rate and&nbsp;<em>many&nbsp;people will gladly pay it</em>. Seller Financing is also a great way to  create&nbsp;<strong>multiple streams of passive income</strong>&nbsp;that act like rental properties but come with virtually&nbsp;<strong>none</strong>&nbsp;of the typical headaches that rental  properties are known for.<br>
  <strong>8) Land is&nbsp;<em>Very Inexpensive&nbsp;</em>to  Own&nbsp;as a&nbsp;Long-Term Investment.</strong><br>
  When you buy a piece of land for the&nbsp;<a href="http://retipster.com/offerprice/">right price</a>, there are no mortgage payments to  make,&nbsp;no utility bills to pay, the cost of property insurance is nominal  (if you have it at all) and property taxes are&nbsp;<em>extremely cheap</em>. If you want to&nbsp;<a href="http://retipster.com/?p=4">park your cash</a>&nbsp;somewhere and forget about it, vacant land could be exactly the  investment vehicle you&rsquo;re looking for.<br>
  <strong>9) Land Gives its Owner Peace of Mind.</strong><br>
  Think about it – land&nbsp;is a long-term,  tangible asset that&nbsp;<em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;wear out,&nbsp;<em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;depreciate, and nothing can get&nbsp;broken,  stolen or destroyed. Put all of these benefits together with your ability to&nbsp;<a href="http://retipster.com/offerprice/">buy it for next-to-nothing</a>… &nbsp; and can you  think of a better combination?<br>
  <strong>10) They Aren&rsquo;t Making Any More Of It.</strong><br>
  Most people don&rsquo;t think of vacant land this  way, but the reality is – land&nbsp;is an&nbsp;<u>extremely valuable  resource</u>&nbsp;with<em>&nbsp;</em><em>limited  quantities available</em>. Especially when you  purchase&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/2014/05/23/10-real-estate-markets-buy-and-hold-made-sense/">land in the path of growth</a>, you will find  yourself with a finite asset that&nbsp;<em>a lot of other people  want to get their hands on</em>.  Stocks, bonds, mutual funds and 401Ks all make sense in certain scenarios,<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>and so does</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href="http://retipster.com/?p=4">land</a></strong>.&nbsp;If you go into this with the intent of  holding&nbsp;<em>the right property for the long-term</em>, it can make a lot more sense (and be a lot  more profitable) than any other retirement vehicle out there.<br>
  <strong>Land  Investing Is A Huge Opportunity</strong></p>
I&rsquo;ll be completely honest  with you. Land investing is&nbsp;<em>without question</em>, the most
